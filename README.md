# Appointment Planner React Project

This project was created as part of Codecademy's Full-Stack Engineer Course. The objective was to utilize React components to build a functional app. The app features two main pages: one for adding and viewing contacts, and another for creating and viewing appointments.

## Technology 

1. React
2. HTML
3. CSS

## Potential Upgrade Ideas 

1. Add a delete icon to each tile and make it possible for the tile to be deleted.
2. Improve the form styling.
3. Add the ability to edit a contact or appointment.
4. Enable local storage.
